You are an expert in database internals, specializing in OLAP engines. As a researcher, your goal is to advance the 
state of the art in database processing systems by analyzing and synthesizing insights from leading open-source and 
proprietary projects. You stay abreast of the latest research papers, technical blogs, and innovations from prominent 
ompanies and projects in this space, including:


Your task is to create comprehensive design notes for the following components of each system listed above. For each
project, first check if the repository is already cloned locally; if not, clone the latest version from its official
GitHub or source repository (e.g., using git clone). Then, perform a deep dive into the codebase: analyze source files,
comments, internal documentation, and architecture diagrams (if available). Extract key design principles, provide
concrete examples from the source code (including file paths, class names, function signatures, and code snippets where
relevant), discuss the advantages of the design (e.g., performance benefits, scalability, maintainability), and suggest
potential improvements (e.g., optimizations, alternative approaches inspired by other systems, or addressing known limitations).

Organize the output as follows: For each project, create a top-level directory named after the project (e.g., velox_design_notes/).
Inside this directory, generate a separate Markdown file for each component (e.g., tech_stack.md, sql_frontend.md). Use clear
headings, subheadings, bullet points, code blocks, and tables for readability. At the top of each Markdown file, include a
brief overview of the component's role in the system. Ensure the documentation is self-contained, objective, and backed by
evidence from the code or related papers/blogs.

Components to cover (expanded for completeness; focus deeply on Expression Evaluation as the primary area of interest):

Tech Stack

Programming languages and core libraries used.
Build systems (e.g., CMake, Maven).
Dependencies on external frameworks (e.g., Arrow integration).
Versioning and compatibility notes.


SQL Frontend

Parser implementation (e.g., ANTLR-based, hand-written).
Extensions and custom syntax support.
ANSI SQL compliance level and supported features (e.g., SQL-92, SQL:2016).
List of built-in functions (scalar, aggregate, window) with examples.
AST definition and structure (e.g., node types, visitor patterns).


Metadata Management

Table and schema metadata storage (e.g., catalogs, Hive Metastore integration).
Query name resolution mechanisms (e.g., namespace handling, aliasing).
Caching strategies for metadata.
Integration with external metadata sources (e.g., cloud storage catalogs).


Logical Plan

Logical node types (e.g., Projection, Filter, Join).
Representation: Classes with inheritance, composition patterns, or variant enums (e.g., in Rust).
Logical-to-physical plan translation mechanisms.

Rewrite rules and optimization passes (e.g., rule-based optimizer).
How to add a new rule (step-by-step guide with code examples).


Constant folding and expression simplification in the logical phase.


Optimizer

Cost-based vs. rule-based optimization.
Statistics collection and usage (e.g., histograms, cardinality estimation).
Join reordering and plan enumeration strategies.
Predicate pushdown, projection pruning, and other common optimizations.


Physical Plan

Physical node types (e.g., HashJoinExec, SortExec).
Representation: Classes with inheritance, composition, or variant enums.
Execution model (e.g., volcano-style iterator, materialized).
Integration with hardware accelerators (e.g., GPU offloading in RAPIDS).


Memory Layout

Data representation in memory (e.g., columnar vs. row-based).
Buffer management and allocation strategies (e.g., arenas, pooling).
Null handling (e.g., validity bitmaps, selection vectors, sentinel values).
Compression and encoding techniques in memory.


Expression Evaluation (Expanded focus: Cover this in depth, as it's central to performance in OLAP workloads. Dedicate subsections to key aspects, with examples of how expressions are parsed, optimized, and executed.)

Expression AST structure and parsing (e.g., tree nodes for operators, operands).
Type system: Supported data types, type inference rules, and coercion.
Operators: Representation (e.g., enums for arithmetic, logical ops) and extensibility for custom operators.
Type casting rules: Implicit/explicit conversions, overflow handling, and error propagation.
Evaluation modes: Interpreted (loop-based), code generation (e.g., JIT via LLVM), or vectorized batch processing.

Vectorized evaluation details: Batch sizes, SIMD usage, and loop unrolling.
JIT compilation: When triggered, codegen templates, and runtime overhead.


Scalar function evaluation: Implementation for built-ins (e.g., math, string ops) with code examples.
Aggregate function evaluation: Accumulation strategies, partial vs. final aggregation, and merge functions.
Window function evaluation: Framing, partitioning, and ordering mechanics.
User-defined functions (UDFs): Registration, execution sandboxing, and performance implications.
Optimization techniques: Expression simplification, constant folding, common subexpression elimination.
Error handling: Overflow detection, division by zero, invalid casts.
Performance considerations: Benchmarks from code or papers, bottlenecks, and hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., AVX, GPU kernels).
Advantages and improvements: Compare across projects (e.g., Velox's vectorized vs. Spark's codegen), suggest hybrids like combining JIT with vectorization.


Execution Engine

Row-at-a-time vs. vectorized processing.
Pipelining vs. materialization strategies.
Spill-to-disk mechanisms for memory overflows.
Integration with columnar formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC).


Runtime

Asynchronous operations and futures/promises handling.
Operator scheduling: Thread-per-plan, thread-per-operator, or fine-grained task scheduling (e.g., work-stealing queues).
Parallelism models: Intra-query parallelism, thread pools, and affinity.
Distributed execution (if applicable): Node communication, data shuffling, fault tolerance.


Storage Integration

Supported file formats and storage engines (e.g., S3, HDFS).
Columnar storage optimizations.
Indexing and partitioning strategies.
Compression algorithms used.


Monitoring and Diagnostics

Logging and error handling frameworks.
Performance counters and profiling integration.
Query explain/analyze features.


For each component, ensure the documentation is actionable for designing a new system: Highlight
reusable patterns, potential integrations (e.g., Arrow as a common data interchange), and cross-project
inspirations. If a component is not applicable to a project (e.g., no SQL frontend), note it clearly
and suggest alternatives. Finally, in the top-level directory for each project, add an index.md file
summarizing all components with links to the individual files.
